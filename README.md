## Download and installation
The program is currently only available for Windows but it has been tested to run successfully on OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) through [Wine (Mac)](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/wine-mac/) without sound effects. 
You can probably get it to work on Linux [in the same way](https://www.linux.com/learn/how-install-and-use-wine-run-windows-applications-linux).

To download the simulation, click [here:](https://github.com/shermansiu/Tag-Theory/raw/TagTheory/Tag%20Theory%20r0110.exe)

Now you can run the simulation!

## How to use

### Recommended speed
If you want to outrun the other player, set your own speed to `200`.

If you want a challenge, choose Option 1, set your speed to `144` and set the enemy's speed to `120`.

### Controlling the player

You can choose how the player will move. The player can move using one of three available methods:
1. Follow the mouse
2. Go in a pre-planned circle route
3. Move according to the WASD keyboard controls

## Closing the simulation
On Windows machines, the simulation might not close while the menu is displayed. 
This is due to the way that the Game Maker Language menus are implemented.

If you want to close the program, start a simulation and close the window as the simulation is running.
