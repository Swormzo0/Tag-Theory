## Installation
The program is currently only available for Windows but it has been tested to run successfully on OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) through [Wine (Mac)](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/wine-mac/) without sound effects. 
You can probably get it to work on Linux [in the same way](https://www.linux.com/learn/how-install-and-use-wine-run-windows-applications-linux).

3. Move according to the WASD keyboard controls
